            <h1 class="very-big-title">We are a design firm specialising in<br><strong>UI/UX, web design and development.</strong></h1>
            <p>We work with companies from all industries and of all sizes, with one goal: to help them solve their problems and achieve their objectives. Here are a few reasons we think you'll like working with us:</p>
          </header>

              <div class="reason__hover-zone">
                <h3 class="big-title">01. Your goals are our goals</h3>
                <p>While we care deeply about aesthetics, we think the priorities of a project should be logic, clarity, creating a gibberish-free site that is going to make sense to the target audience, so much so that they won’t be able to help but want to try the product out.</p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="reason__hover-zone">
                <h3 class="big-title">02. We speak your language</h3>
                <p>We understand most people are not designers and may have difficulty translating their objectives into actionable design decisions so we invite our clients to discuss their strategies and objectives openly with us, and leave the matter of how they will be reflected throughout the design to us. In other words, we speak your language, so you don’t have to learn ours.</p>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="reason--small">
              <div class="reason__hover-zone">
                <h3 class="big-title">03. We’re highly Organised</h3>
                <p>We understand that for us to create work that hits the mark, we must have a clear understanding of the whole picture, and communicate that clearly to everyone involved.</p>
              </div>
            </li>

                <h3 class="big-title">04. We go the extra mile</h3>
                <p>We are a new team and have yet to establish a reputation, and we would like to start on the right foot so we will do our utmost best to make sure our clients leave feeling impressed, and with one or two fewer things to worry about.</p>
