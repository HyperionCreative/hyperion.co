    <h1>Starting on the Right Foot</h1>
    <p>For this project, we have been tasked with building the <em>front end of Kartist, and have worked closely with their internal back-end team</em> to ensure we are always on the same page, and the final <strong>product</strong> works as expected. We worked with their team to put together a <em>plan that would allow us to develop the project modularly and ensure each component could be developed independently</em>. This afforded us a great degree of flexibility, while maintaining <strong>compatibility</strong> with the back-end team's work/components.</p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>One of our key objectives was to create an experience that is fluid and <strong>consistent across devices</strong>; because of this, performance and stability were crucial.</p>
    <p>We used user interaction prediction to cache the resources we anticipated were going to be the most requested and thus reduced load times between pages. We also used AngularJS's one time binding to deal with large collections of items and ended up reducing the no. of watchers, which considerably reduced the CPU load.</p>

    <h3>Browser Extensions</h3>
    <p>We also developed the browser extensions Kartist's users use to add items to a Kart, manage lists or edit their accounts. The extensions rely on custom scrapers we developed for each supported site.</p>

    <h4>Testing & Delivery</h4>
    <p>With the code and <strong>API</strong> being well documented, we tested each <strong>AngularJS</strong> component and the whole interface to make sure everything works as expected and our work is compatible with the back-end of the app, then handed over the deliverables and control to the GitHub repository.</p>
